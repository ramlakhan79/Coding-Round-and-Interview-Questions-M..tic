Problem Statement:

Title: Largest Palindromic Number

Description: 
Given a string `str` consisting of digits ('0' to '9'), write a program to find the largest palindromic number that can be formed using the digits of the string. A palindromic number is a number that reads the same forward and backward.

If no valid palindromic number can be formed (other than "0"), the program should return "0".

The function should use the digits optimally to construct the largest palindromic number, considering the following rules:
1. Digits can appear at most as many times as they are present in the input string.
2. If a single-digit center is required, it should be the largest possible digit.

Input Format:
- A single string, `str`, containing only digits ('0' to '9').

Output Format:
- A single string representing the largest palindromic number that can be formed.

Test Cases and Explanations:

Test Case 1:
Input:
1919
Output:
9119
Explanation:
- All digits appear twice that they can be symmetrically placed, forming "9119".

---

Test Case 2:
Input:
000011
Output:
100001
Explanation:
- The digits '1' appear twice, and '0' appears four times.
- We can form the largest palindrome by placing the '1' in the center and the '0's symmetrically around it.
- The largest palindromic number formed is "100001".
- Leading zeros are avoided unless the entire palindrome is "0".

Test Case 3:
Input:
12345
Output:
5
Explanation:
- None of the digits appear more than once.
- The largest single-digit (5) is chosen as the palindrome center.

---

Test Case 4:
Input:
000000
Output:
0
Explanation:
- All digits are zeros. 
- The largest valid palindromic number is "0".

---

Test Case 5:
Input:
543215432
Output:
543212345
Explanation:
- Digits appear in such a way that they can be symmetrically placed, forming "543212345".
- The largest possible palindromic number is created.

---

Test Case 6:
Input:
9
Output:
9
Explanation:
- Only one digit (9) is present. 
- It itself forms the largest palindromic number.

Constraints:
1<=n<=10^5.
0<=s[i]<=9.
A string containing only digits ('0' to '9').
